# Security
- ### Why penetration testing is planning:
    - ### The need for a methodology approach
    - ### How to establish the testing methodology

```
Systematic approach to professional security testing that follows a structured process based on the motives of a potential attackers when targeting an organization
```
 ## Type of testing
 - ### `Compliance test`: there are a number of standards that are out there in the industry
 - ### `Vulnerability assessment`: looking for the flaws or weakness of a system (such as credentials, ...)
 - ### `Penetration testing`: relate with the state of the system, network security (such as: network footprint), consist of 2 type:
    - ### `Active`: reconnaissance as being intrusive and involves attempting zone transfers
    - ### `Passive`: will detected or blocked by Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) (nonintrusive approach of testing)

## A simple abstract methodology consists of:
- ### Planning
- ### Non-intrusive target search
- ### Intrusive target search
- ### Remote target assessment
- ### Local target assessment
- ### Data analysis
- ### Reporting
